# Bioinformatics-Project
The code for a Bioinformatics Project I made.

This is a simple project which gives a comparative analysis of the suitability of various ML and DL models to a chosen dataset.

To run it go to 
**Data Gathering** 
in Research Paper->Notebooks and enter your query in the first cell. From there you can follow the instructions as given in the notebook itself.

Each notebook is labelled as required and only needs the data in certain formats. You can clone this repo, run
### `jupyter notebook`
in your temrinal  and as long as its downloaded, you can get started.
